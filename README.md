# Intellichoice-Quiz-Engine

# The purpose of this web application is to provide a quiz and practice engine to supplement the math tutoring provided by IntelliChoice. The application will feature a minimalist design with a simplistic user interface.

# Our hope is that this project can create the framework for a powerful online tool to supplement the in-person tutoring provided by IntelliChoice. It can also serve as a means for IntelliChoice to better understand their students and the students' progress.

# To run the api it will be necessary to have docker installed which requires at least windows pro if you are utilizing windows. It is possible to grab one if you are a student visit microsoft axure for your copy it may be an education OS but that also works.

# Then navigate to the root of the Repository folder(/intellichoice-quiz-engine) and run "docker-compose up"
